# Hi, I'm Justin :wave:

## A bit about me

### ...with regards to the tech industry

I am currently a Technical Community Manager at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), focusing primarily on the [Terraform AWS provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws), so you'll likely see most of my work in the comments sections of issues and pull requests in that repository. Prior to moving to the Technical Community Manager role, I spent three years as a Senior Support Engineer for Terraform Enterprise. Terraform, and infrastructure-as-code as a whole, is something that I have a strong passion for. 

### ...as a human

My main hobby outside of tech is film photography. I find the limitations of film really help me to focus, rather than shooting 15 of the same photo that I have to later decide between. Outside of that, you'll find my wife and I watching terrible reality TV shows or genre films (shout out to [A24](https://a24films.com) and [Fantastic Fest](https://fantasticfest.com)). I am a born-and-raised Austinite; something I'm frequently told is rare.
