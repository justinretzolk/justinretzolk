# Hi, I'm Justin :wave:

## A bit about me

I am currently a Technical Community Manager at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), focusing primarily on the [Terraform AWS provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws), so you'll likely see most of my work in the comments sections of issues and pull requests in that repository.

Prior to moving to the Technical Community Manager role, I spend three years as a Senior Support Engineer for Terraform Enterprise. Terraform, and infrastructure-as-codeas a whole is something that I have a strong passion for. 

**I am not a developer by trade,** but have picked up some Go along the way and can generally read along with Ruby, due to previous roles that led me to do so. I've done quite a bit of Bash scripting, but would hesitate to call myself "proficient".

Outside of work, I spent most of my time with my wife and our two dogs; a French Bulldog and a Great Dane. Generally, you'll find us watching terrible reality TV shows or horror/scifi films (think anything you'd see coming out of [A24](https://a24films.com) or that would show at [Fantastic Fest](https://fantasticfest.com)). I am a born-and-raised Austinite; something I'm frequently told is increasingly rare.

Recently, I recorded an interview with a friend and colleague over on his YouTube channel, [tutoriaLinux](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvA_wgsX6eFAOXI8Rbg_WiQ). If you'd like to get to know me a bit better, that may be found [here](https://youtu.be/aQHAKgcDNPA).

## Projects I love

Outside of Terraform, I've long been a fan of the open source community. It's what drove me to accept my current role, so that I could give back to the communities that have helped me over the years. You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/justinretzolk/dotfiles), though I can't in good faith recommend that you use them directly. A few highlights:

While I've attempted to switch to VSCode, I've settled into a combination of `zsh`, [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), and [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). I'd be remiss if I didn't mention [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) as well.

I also run a small homelab setup, consisting of [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) for secrets and TLS management, [Consul](https://www.consul.io) for service discovery, [Fabio](https://fabiolb.net) for load balancing and reverse proxy, and [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io) for container orchestration. I've found that this is the way that I learn best; by doing.
